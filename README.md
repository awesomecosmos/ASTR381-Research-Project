**Project Title:** Interstellar comet observations made with VLT/MUSE 

**Project Supervisor:** Dr. Michele Bannister 

**Project Duration:** 07-08-2020 to 30-10-2020

**Project Abstract:** The second interstellar object discovered by astronomers is the comet 2I/Borisov, which was discovered
in August 2019. It was observed using the European Southern Observatory's VLT/MUSE
instrumentation during the period of November 2019 to March 2020 for 20 epochs. The aim of this
research project is to investigate the geometry of the trajectory of 2I/Borisov during this period and
generate a data table with its geometrical and observational information. This data analysis and
tabulation was done by accessing and querying the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre data archives,
and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Horizons database, and joining these data with observational
data obtained from each epoch of observation on VLT/MUSE, to produce a data table comprising
of geometric and observational information pertaining to the trajectory of 2I/Borisov. Using these
data, the observational circumstances of 2I/Borisov are analysed, and it is found that these observations
were made in dicult conditions. Yet, there are numerous applications for this data table,
with the primary application being the analysis of the chemical composition spectrum of the comet,
which aids in understanding the environment this interstellar comet originates from, which is most
likely a planetary formation system.
